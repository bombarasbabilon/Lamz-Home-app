# 📱 Installing Health Tracker on iPhone

## Add to Home Screen

Follow these steps to install Health Tracker as a standalone app on your iPhone (just like Pocket Option):

### Step 1: Open in Safari
1. Open **Safari** browser on your iPhone
2. Navigate to your deployed app URL (e.g., `https://lamz-home-app.vercel.app`)

### Step 2: Add to Home Screen
1. Tap the **Share** button (square with arrow pointing up) at the bottom of Safari
2. Scroll down and tap **"Add to Home Screen"**
3. Edit the name if desired (default: "Health")
4. Tap **"Add"** in the top right corner

### Step 3: Launch the App
1. Find the **Health Tracker** icon on your home screen
2. Tap it to launch as a full-screen app
3. The app will run in standalone mode without Safari UI

## Features in Standalone Mode

✅ **Full-screen experience** - No browser bars  
✅ **Fast loading** - Cached for offline use  
✅ **Home screen icon** - Quick access like native apps  
✅ **Standalone launch** - Opens independently from Safari  
✅ **Push notifications** - (coming soon)  
✅ **Background sync** - Data syncs automatically  

## Troubleshooting

**App not opening in full screen?**
